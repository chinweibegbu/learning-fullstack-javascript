## Backend vs Frontend
### Terms Used
**Web Server**: A process running on a computer that listens for incoming requests for information over the internet and sends back responses.

**Protocol**: The specific format of a request and the resulting response e.g. HTTP

**Application Server**: The collection of programming logic required to deliver dynamic content to a client, manage security, process payments, and myriad other tasks. Also known as the "*application*"

**Database**: A collection of information. Databases are divided into two types:
1. Relational databases: Stores information in tables with columns and rows e.g. [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/), [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
2. Non-relational or NoSQL databases: Uses non-table storage systems such as key-value pairs or documnet storage e.g. [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/), [Redis](https://redis.io/)

**Web API**: A web Application Programming Interface (API) is a collection of predefined ways of, or rules for, interacting with a web applicationâ€™s data, often through an HTTP request-response cycle.

**Authentication**: The process of validating the identity of a user e.g. with username and password login, with 3-rd party authorisers like Google and GitHub

**Authorization:**: Controls which users have access to which resources and actions

### Development Technologies
#### Backend Frameworks
A **framework** is a collection of tools that shapes the organisation of your backend and provides efficient ways of accomplishing otherwise difficult tasks. Some backend frameworks include:
* [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) (PHP)
* [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) (JS, Node.js)
* [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) (Ruby)
* [Spring](https://spring.io/) (Java)
* [Java Server Faces](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javaee/javaserverfaces-139869.html) (Java)
* [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) (Python)
* [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) (Python)
* [ASP.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/learn/aspnet/what-is-aspnet) (C#)

#### Development Stacks
A **stack** is a collection of technologies used to create the front-end and back-end of a web application. Common development stacks include:
* [MEAN stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEAN_(software_bundle)): MongoDB, Express.js, Angular.js, Node.js
* [LAMP stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_(software_bundle)): Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP
