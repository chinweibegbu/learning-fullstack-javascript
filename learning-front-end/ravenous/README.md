# _ravenous_: A React-based Restaurant Recommendation System

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Project Purpose
The aim of this project is to build and deploy a restaurant recommendation application using React, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as part of the tech stack while using Git for version control and GitHub for hosting.

## Technologies used
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JavaScript
4. React
5. Git and GitHub

## Features

- Users can repeatedly make multiple queries for a restaurant recommendation.

## Future work
- [x] Create the base application components
- [x] Style the application
- [x] Utilise component information transfer techniques using `props`
- [x] Integrate the Yelp API
- [ ] Add application tests
- [ ] Deploy the application


## Available Scripts
In the project directory, use the following commands:
- `npm start`: To run in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. The page will reload when you make changes. You may also see any lint errors in the console.
- `npm test`: Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
- `npm run build`: Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The app is ready to be deployed.
